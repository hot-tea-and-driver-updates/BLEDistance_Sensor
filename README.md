## Description

The BLE Distance Sensor repository contains a main file with relevant code in order to properly measure data from the HC-SR04 sensor and display these values over BLE using the BLESS middleware library. The main file contains code related to the software based interrupt, initializes hardware and makes use of the BLE protocol to properly display values. This library is designed to work with the HC-SR04 sensor and PSoC6 MCU. 

## Features

- Software based interrupt to correctly measure distance from HC-SR04 sensor
- BLE support to accurately display sensor data as characteristics on a BLE supported application.
