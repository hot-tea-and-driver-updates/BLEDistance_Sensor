## Description

The DFROBOT LCD Library repository contains a source file with relevant function definitions and a main file containing driver code to provide an  interface to control the LCD display. The source code makes use of the I2C communication protocol to properly configure hardware register values and initialize the LCD for user control. This library is designed to work specifically with DFROBOT I2C-based LCD displays, making it easy to integrate and utilize the LCD functionality in your PSoC6 projects.

## Features

- Software based interrupt to correctly measure distance from HC-SR04 sensor
- BLE support to accurately display sensor data as characteristics on a BLE supported application.
